        "Required functionality of your recommendation system:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Given thousands of articles, you compute the hash value for each article. The 1st document shows how to create 1024 bits hash--this is equivalent to 1024 rows in minhash while in this case, each hash function produces one-bit int and in minhash each hash function/permutation produces 1 regular 4-byte integer.\n",

        "prob(matching 1 particular bit between 2 doc) = 1 - h/b = 1 - arccos ( cosine_Sim(doc1, doc2) ) / pi\n",
        "\n",
        "That said, given the cosine similarity of the two documents, you know what's the probability for two hashed bits to match.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now you want to use the same idea of band and rows for 1024 (or any other number) hashed bits to control TPR/TNR\n",
        "\n",
        "2. With num_bands, num_rows (i.e. number of bytes*8) as parameters, you save the hash value for each doc in a dictionary, using hash value as the key, and dictionary value is a list with doc ID as list member.\n",
        "\n",
        "Say you use 1024 bits total and you divide them into 16 bands and each band has 64 bits (or rows) or 8 bytes. An 64-bits integer is your hash value for one particular band.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you have 16 bands, then you have 16 different dictionaries in total, with each corresponding to one band. Each article will produce 16 hash values (each with 64 bits, from one band) and each hash will be used as the key to the corresponding dictionary. The values for each dictionary are lists of article IDs that hash (64 bits, for that band) into the same \"bucket\".\n",
        "\n",
        "3. For query, you are given an article and cosine similarity threshold, you want to return top_n articles that have cosine similarity >= threshold and list them in descending order of similarity with options to print ID only or to print the first N characters from each article. Generally, you compute 16 hash values (assuming you have 16 bands)  candidates are found in 16 dictionaries with these 16 hash values as keys. If no key exists in any of the dictionaries then there is no match. If two dictionaries have matching keys then you combine two lists as candidates. Then you do validation to make sure the similarity is above the threshold.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alternatively, you can use just one big dictionary. In this case, a hash value 01011101011110111 from band 1 will be converted to a string for dictionary key: \"01011101011110111b1\" with \"b1\" indicating band 1, so only band 1 hash can possibly get the same key.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: You need to complete the code with the required functionality, and write a full project report explaining what you are doing with the code as an appendix. You need to demonstrate with some example query articles/ query strings. In your report, you need to compute what is your TPR, and FNR for a few sets of typical values of num_bands, num_rows, and similarity thresholds, plus corresponding example queries.\n",

For query, you are given an article and cosine similarity threshold, you want to return top_n articles that have cosine similarity >= threshold and list them in descending order of similarity with options to print ID only or to print the first N characters from each article. Generally, you compute 16 hash values (assuming you have 16 bands)  candidates are found in 16 dictionaries with these 16 hash values as keys. If no key exists in any of the dictionaries then there is no match. If two dictionaries have matching keys then you combine two lists as candidates. Then you do validation to make sure the similarity is above the threshold.\n",
